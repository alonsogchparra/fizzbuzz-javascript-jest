# Fizzbuzz Javascript / Jest

This is an exercise (interview code's style).

The goals of this project are:

- If the number is multiple of 3 return **fizz**
- If the number is multiple of 5 return **buzz**
- If the number is multiple of 3 and 5 return **fizzbuzz**
- If the number is 0 return 0
- If the typeof is not a number return **Error: the argument is not a number**
- Build arrow function to check if the added number can be divide by 3 and 5 (Optional)
- Build Print function to show each number what would return (Optional)
- Test each case with Jest


I'm using Jest to make the tests. To keep running the tests you can use this command
```
npm run test:watch
```
